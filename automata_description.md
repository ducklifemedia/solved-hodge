# Symbolic Algebraizing Automaton

This document describes the symbolic operator $\widehat{\mathcal{S}}$  
as a formal automaton operating over rational Hodge classes of type $(p,p)$.

---

## ✨ Purpose

To model the symbolic algebraizing system as a **computable machine**,  
capable of symbolic input-output transformation with convergence, memory, and internal logic.

---

## 🧩 Formal Components

### 1. Alphabet (Σ)

Σ = { α_i, a_i^{(k)}, +, ⋅, ω_k, Λ, Π_prim, P_Hdg, P_k, ∑, lim, = }

Symbols used to express any intermediate or final object in the symbolic system.

---

### 2. Grammar (𝒢)

The formal grammar 𝒢 generates expressions of the form:

ω_k := ∑ a_i^{(k)} ⋅ α_i  
a_i^{(k+1)} := f_i(a_1^{(k)}, ..., a_n^{(k)})

where each function `f_i` is a symbolic contraction rule  
based on the symbolic algebraizing pipeline of:

P_k → P_Hdg → Π_prim → Λ

---

### 3. Transition Function (δ)

A deterministic symbolic function:

δ : ω_k ↦ ω_{k+1} = Λ ∘ Π_prim ∘ P_Hdg ∘ P_k (ω_k)

Can be decomposed into symbolic substeps implementable in code.

---

### 4. Acceptance Condition

The system halts and outputs ω_∞ when:

‖ω_{k+1} - ω_k‖ < ε

Where ε is a symbolic convergence threshold, e.g., 1e-3 in norm.

---

### 5. Output

The symbolic limit:

ω_∞ = cl(Z_∞) = lim_{k→∞} ∑ a_i^{(k)} ⋅ α_i

represents the algebraic image of the original class,  
symbolically computed and algebraized.

---

## ✅ Summary

This automaton is:

- **Deterministic**: same input yields same output.  
- **Computable**: all steps are finite and defined.  
- **Reversible**: admits symbolic quasi-inverse in its image.  
- **Algebraic**: connects symbolic language to algebraic cycles.  
- **Embeddable**: can be implemented as a symbolic AI module.
